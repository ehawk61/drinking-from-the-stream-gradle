# Drinking From The Stream Gradle Remix 

## Background 
This repo is just a remix of Mark Heckler's [Drinking From The Stream](https://github.com/mkheck/drinking-from-the-stream) repo using Gradle. 
This was to teach myself how to work with Gradle submodules and get a closer look at Mark's code. I considered this is a "dirty room" implementation meaning that most of the code is identical to Mark's with minor changes.

## ToDo List 
- [X] Add source submodule to repo 
- [X] Add sink submodule to repo  
- [ ] Add processor submodule to repo 
- [ ] Refactor to use application.properties for some of the values
- [X] Create necessary Dockerfile(s)
- [ ] Create docker compose files to start everything
